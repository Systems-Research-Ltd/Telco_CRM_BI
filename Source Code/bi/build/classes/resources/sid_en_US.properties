#Shared Information/Data Model or SID 
#is a unified reference data model providing a single set of terms
# for business objects in telecommunications. The objective is to 
#enable people in different departments, companies or geographical
# locations to use the same terms to describe the same real world objects,
# practices and relationships.
#The TeleManagement Forum's Frameworx Shared Information/Data (SID)
# model provides the telecommunications industry with a common
# vocabulary and set of information/data definitions and relationships
# used in the definition of NGOSS architectures, now known as Frameworx
